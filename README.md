# TODO

* If LSP is present, only use Buffer inside of strings and comments 
* Merge completion results w/ same name/value
* Replace LuaSnip with vim-vsnip
* Group by plugins and languages
* Open locallist but don't move cursor to it
* Only open nvim-tree when opening a directory. Do not start with it open when opening blank, empty, or regular files.
* Retab mapped to <leader>-Tab
* Stripwhitespace 
* Symbols for whitespace 
* Distinguish between written languare (LaTeX/markdown text/strings/comments etc...) and regular text/code. Integrate languagetool and common word reccomendations (like text messaging provides) for writing mode.
